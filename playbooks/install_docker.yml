# This is modified from a playbook by Aruna Lakmal
# https://www.techcrumble.net/2019/12/how-install-docker-and-docker-compose-using-ansible-playbooks/

# This playbook requires -K (--ask-become-pass) because the remote user must become root 
# to lock apt (most apt functions require sudo), if your remote_user does not have NOPASSWD powers

  - hosts: main
    become: yes

# User that Ansible runs as on the remote system can be passed or defined below.
